                Cascading style sheets, also known as CSS, are the cornerstone of all aesthetically pleasing, 
                diverse websites that exist today. As quoted in one of my reference articles, "without it, 
                websites would still be plain text on white backgrounds."

                CSS provides many implicit styling
                elements, but yet still allows a developer to modify any element to better fit their specific
                design vision. 
                <br>
                <br>
                As shown in the code example, which is actually a snippet of the CSS 
                stylesheet for this website, shows specifically the use of embedded colors inside of the CSS
                library as well as a custom one.
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="post1_css_color.PNG">
            </figure>
            <p>
                In the image above, the background-color element in the body format section displays the
                use of a custom color created using RGB values explictly. Additionally, the color element
                inside the h1 section utilizes a built-in default color to the CSS library, thus displaying
                the two different ways to choose colors for style elements.
                <br>
                <br>
                Additionally, while many developers will choose to utilize an external CSS file as their
                stylesheet, the style tag in HTML allows for CSS style elements to be written directly into
                the HTML file. This is most useful for pages that will have a unique style and typically
                fewer elements that the developer wants to be styled.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                It is easy to see how internal CSS style could quickly clutter up a web page with a lot of
                elements, but for any simple web design it is quite useful to keep everything in one file.
