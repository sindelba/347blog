                Having a depth of CS knowledge is certainly a great power, but per the words of Winston 
                Churchill, it also comes with a great responsibility. Since unfortunately it seems that
                those with malicious intentions will always be present, it is important to know what
                vulnerabilities exist in the content we create as web developers.

                Insecurity of HTTP Connections
            </h2>
            <p>
                HTTP, which stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol, is the
                easiest and fastest web page request service. However, whatever it gains in speed it loses
                almost immediately in vulnerabilities. HTTP requests do not require any sort of domain
                validation and there is no encryption of the data sent or received over an HTTP connection.

                The code snippet displayed above demonstrates, as the comments say, a GET request over an
                insecure HTTP connection. Since there is no validation required for this request, it is
                especially vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks. There is also no mechanism in place to
                ensure that the data being transmitted is doing so over a secure connection in HTTP
                requests or that any data being sent via an HTTP connection is reaching its proper location.
                <br>

                The most effective way to rid your web application of many of the vulnerabilities of HTTP is
                to instead use an HTTPS connection. HTTPS, which stands for <b>H</b>yper<b>T</b>ext 
                <b>T</b>ransfer <b>P</b>rotocol <b>S</b>ecure, was created to eliminate many of the problems
                with HTTP connections by encrypting all transmitted data, requiring SSL certificates, and
                operating in a more private layer of the network architecture. However, almost all HTTPS
                certificates require payment, which is not accessible to all web developers. HTTP connections
                are not any cause for concern unless you are entering information into the website such as
                a username, password, or any personally identifiable information. If you are stuck in a
                situation where you have to input information under an insecure connection, follow these
                simple rules:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Use a unique, highly secure password that has no personal information (i.e. pets
                        names, your name, a family member's name, etc.)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Diversify the order of your password; capitalize a random couple letters in the 
                        middle instead of just the first, use more obscure special characters like % or ^
                        as opposed to ! @ and *, and put them in a random order.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If possible, use a fake name or nickname that would be more difficult to attach to
                        any other information found about you.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Do not, under any circumstances, provide answers to security questions. Most things
                        that require security questions use a very similar selection and your most private
                        assets could be quickly compromised.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                In summary, HTTP connections, while they are insecure for data transmission, are completely
                sufficient for any website where no data input or retrieval is required. Do not let the
                browser 'Not Secure' message deter you from accessing a website, just always proceed with
                caution.
