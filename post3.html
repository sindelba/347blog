            How to be an Ethical Web Developer

            Now that technology is readily available to so many people, it has become
            more important than ever to consider the implications of design choices,
            content selection, and cultural backgrounds when creating web programs. It is
            our job as developers to make sure our products are sufficient to service
            all kinds of people to the best of our ability, and here is a quick guide to
            one of the aspects of web design that should be considered to better serve others.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Color Usage
        </h2>
        <p>
            As developers, unless we ourselves have a disability, we often overlook the
            implications of some of our actions. One of the most obvious barriers to
            ethical design we face is color choices conducive to colorblindness. The images
            below provides a wonderful visual to show how people with different types of
            colorblindness view the same image.
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="color-blindness.jpg" height="600px" width="650px" 
            alt="four pinwheels in a square, one rainbow, and the other three discolored to 
            demonstrate colorblindness">
            <img src="color-blindness-types-1.png" height="590px" width="850px"
            alt="three color wheels, one regularly colored and the other two discolored for
            colorblindness above three images of a field of flowers also discolored to match
            with the color wheel of colorblindness">
        </figure>
        <p>
            Statistically, the most common type of colorblindness is Deuteranomaly, which is
            a type of colorblindness that makes green look more like red but is still often
            identifiable to the person after some scrutiny. In order to best serve potential
            website users that may be affected by colorblindness, web developers need to be
            hyperaware of the colors they use on their websites, especially when trying to
            distinguish between items like in a graph, so they are visible to all. While red
            and green are contrasting colors to those without colorblindness, they should not
            be used next to each other or in any combination of a back/foreground. 
        </p>
        
        <p><code>&ltstyle&gt; color:rgb(123, 161, 123); &lt/style&gt;</code></p>
        <p> In CSS, using the color picker tool and changing the RGB values of a color manually 
            is a simple and effective way to make sure the red/green content of any color on 
            your page is not too similar to another.
