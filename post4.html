            How to be an Ethical Web Developer Pt.2

        <p>
            As I have said before, now that technology is readily available to 
            so many people, it has become more important than ever to consider
            the implications of design choices, content selection, and cultural
            backgrounds when creating web programs. Tt is our job as developers 
            to make sure our products are sufficient to service all kinds of
            people to the best of our ability. In my last blog post, I talked 
            about the importance of color usage when it came to web design. 
            Today I will be writing about another ethical and accessibility 
            concern within web programs that needs to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Vision Impairments

        <p>
            With the creation of other technologies such as screen readers, the
            online world seems to be more accessible for the vision impaired
            already. However, unless the existing websites provide elements for
            such a reader to read, their benefits drops significantly. For
            someone with zero vision, a webpage made up almost entirely of
            images, something fairly typical in today's world, would be nearly
            impossible to understand unless the developers specifically addressed
            the need for accessible alternatives. the HTML <code>&ltimg&gt;</code>
            tag contains an alt element that allows the webpage creator to add a
            description of what the image contains for a person who cannot see it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code id="exmp">&ltimg src="img_girl.jpg" alt="Girl in a jacket" width="500" height="600"></code>
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Additionally, it is best practice to distinguish elements and
            information based on multiple criteria and to follow universal
            conventions as much as possible. For example, do not put anything
            on a webpage in underlined blue text unless it is a hyperlink. Many
            websites still distinguish elements based on color alone, which is
            also a problem for screen readers that cannot see color elements much
            like a person.
