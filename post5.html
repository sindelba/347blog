            Animations in CSS

        <p>
            Animations are a common and relatively simple way to create diversity
            in a web page as well as a fun way to show off one's web development
            skills to a non-tech person. While the code behind a CSS animation
            is not difficult to write, it appears much more intricate and
            impressive to the average unknowing website visitor. The most common
            type of animation is the one seen demonstrated on this page:
            text and/or background changing colors. Typically only one element
            will change at a time to minimize how distracting it can be, but
            since this post is showing off animations it is demonstrating both
            at once.

        <p>
            The code snippet displayed above demonstrates an animation that
            will change the background color of the <code>div</code> element
            over the course of four seconds.

            It is possible to have an animation apply to only one specific 
            section of a web page thanks to element tags/<code>div id</code> 
            assignments, which can allow a developer to <a id="ex">emphasize</a>
            a specific part of the web 
            <br> content if they so desire. A developer
            can use nearly any style element embedded in the CSS library as
            an element for their animation, as seen above with the increase in
            font size included in the single word animation.

            While animations, specifically color change animations, look fun and
            exciting to the average viewer, it is important to still consider the
            implications of such animations for vision-impaired viewers and how
            they will affect the person's ability to read the content and to make
            sure any technologies like screen readers will not be inhibited.
