        Highest High Points of the Class:
    </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The textbook!!! The examples and content from
                the online textbook were such a great help.
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The in-class labs were super helpful to
                identify what I understood easily and what
                I needed to spend more time working on 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                The projects were incredibly relevant and
                interesting and the partner aspect for p2
                and p3 was very helpful
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Being shown how to use the dev tools in the
                browser was awesome and helped me to get ideas
                about how to fix problems I ran into during the
                project development
            </li>
        </ul>

        Possible Changes for Future Classes:

            I think it would be interesting to split the content
            up into frontend development and backend development,
            possibly by making kind of two teams out of the students
            based on which one they're more interested in and do
            the second and third projects with designated roles like
            that
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            With the idea above though, it would most likely require
            at least one additional professor/TA in order to effectively
            teach basically two things at once
        </li>
        <br>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Overall, this course was awesome and I think everything we did
        made sense and felt important to learning web development. Thank
        you for a great semester and I can't wait for 447 in the spring!
